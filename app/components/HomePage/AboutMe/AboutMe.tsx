					<h3>I hate writing these types of things.</h3>
					<p>I think I&apos;m a really likable guy! On the rare occasion, I&apos;ve even been told I&apos;m funny and intelligent... but you will learn <em>none of that</em> from the following paragraphs.</p>
					<p>My name is still Henry! I&apos;m an engineer and designer with a B.S. degree in Creative Technology and Design. I enjoy solving problems through programming, electronics, physical fabrication, web development and graphic design, among many other avenues. I love both learning and creating, both for their own sakes and for the sake of helping to solve all sorts of problems.</p>
					<p>I also enjoy playing piano, weaving, hiking with my dog and rock climbing.</p>
